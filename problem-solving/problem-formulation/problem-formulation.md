To further break down the "Problem Formulation" step, it could be divided into:

1. **Problem Definition**: This step involves understanding and defining the problem that needs to be solved. You define the problem in clear, precise terms and break it down into smaller, manageable parts. This is about understanding what needs to be achieved without considering the implementation yet. 

2. **Test Formulation**: Here, based on your understanding from the previous step, you formulate the failing tests. These tests serve as concrete goals that a correct solution should achieve. The tests are based on the problem's definition and clearly express what a solution to the problem should look like.

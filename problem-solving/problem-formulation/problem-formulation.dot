You define the problem in clear, precise terms and break it down into smaller, manageable parts. This is about understanding what needs to be achieved without considering the implementation yet."]

These tests serve as concrete goals that a correct solution should achieve. The tests are based on the problem's definition and clearly express what a solution to the problem should look like."]
